## **🔹 Challenges & Development Insights**
### **1️⃣ Documentation Effort**
- Spent **more time than initially planned** on documentation.  
- Once the core algorithm was working, additional effort was put into **structuring & documenting** the process.  

### **2️⃣ Extensive EDA & Quality Control**
- Incorporated multiple **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** and **data validation steps**.  
- This added **overhead**, but was necessary to ensure **data quality & integrity**.  

### **3️⃣ Iterative Feature Engineering**
- Developing features required **several iterations**.  
- Some approaches didn't work as expected, leading to **back-and-forth adjustments**.  

### **4️⃣ Computational Complexity in Model Training**
- **Random Forest** was the starting point, but training was **time-consuming** due to:  
  - **High computational cost**  
  - **Handling class imbalance**  - especially SMOTE is a killer notebook start freezing and had to do a couple of times restart or the server and even restart of the PC
  - **Testing multiple parameter combinations**  
  - **Experimenting with parallelization**, which didn’t always yield expected speed-ups.
